# TB-330XU
This is description of my actions how I got more useful and comfortable experience with my tablet
> 🍀 All of this is done on Windows.
# DISCLAIMER
Be careful what you do, if you don't know what this command will do, I advise you not to execute it. This is not a tutorial, just my experience, so again, be careful
# What Not Works
in [LineageOS 22.2](https://github.com/MisterZtr/LineageOS_gsi/releases)
- Bluetooth Audio : Go to Treble Settings → Audio Settings, turn off "Use System Wide BT HAL"
- Headphone Jack : No mitigation yet, but you can inspect and do remedy

### CREATE DUMP FROM YOUR DEVICE!
 - If you want to do something from this you must create dump first. **otherwise you will not able to restore IMEI or your tablet from bricked state.**
 - To do that you must folow [Dump](#dump-all)
